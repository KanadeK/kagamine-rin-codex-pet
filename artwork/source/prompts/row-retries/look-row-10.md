Create Codex v2 pet look row 10 for `kagamine-rin` as exactly 8 full-body frames in this order: 180, 202.5, 225, 247.5, 270, 292.5, 315, 337.5.

Use the canonical base, standard contact sheet, layout guide, approved four-cardinal strip, and `qa/look-mechanics.md`. Draw the complete eight-pose row as one coherent animation family, interpolating even 22.5-degree steps between the cardinal pose families. Keep the same pet identity, face construction, materials, palette, markings, and props. Each direction must read correctly at pet size and join continuously at the 000 and 180 boundaries.

DIRECTION TARGETS — use these to shape the coherent row, not as pixel-level landmark gates:

1. `180`: vertical DOWN; no horizontal requirement.
2. `202.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
3. `225`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
4. `247.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
5. `270`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT; no vertical requirement.
6. `292.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.
7. `315`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.
8. `337.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.

Cardinals must be unmistakable. Intermediate poses should broadly occupy the intended quadrant and advance naturally through the ordered loop. Minor pupil, nose, eyelid, or aiming-feature deviations are acceptable when the overall direction, continuity, identity, and motion remain coherent. Do not deform the character merely to make every intermediate axis independently obvious.

HARD LAYOUT AND CONTINUITY CONTRACT — DETERMINISTIC REGISTRATION: draw exactly eight separated pose groups in left-to-right direction order. Keep enough chroma-only space between neighboring poses that each complete pose can be detected without cutting through foreground. Approximate the guide's equal spacing, but do not distort a pose merely to hit an exact source-canvas coordinate; deterministic assembly will crop the eight ordered groups, then apply one shared scale and baseline.

Use the same body height, head size, baseline, and planted-body position across the generated family. Never overlap neighboring poses, merge two poses into one connected group, crop foreground at the outer canvas edge, or resize one pose independently.

Keep the feet, base, or lower torso planted at the same coordinates across all eight frames. Express direction through the eyes, face, head, upper body, and physically appropriate prop movement, not by moving, rotating, or rescaling the entire sprite.

ROW-BOUNDARY LOCK: 180 must continue directly from row 9's 157.5, matching its body size, baseline, planted anchor, expression, and construction. 337.5 must be one even 22.5-degree step before 000: nearly up-facing while remaining on the overall left-hand arc. Do not distort pupils, nose, or body geometry merely to exaggerate the subtle horizontal component.

PRE-RETURN CHECK: reject this result if it does not contain eight separated pose groups in the required order; neighboring poses overlap; foreground is cropped at the outer canvas edge; any frame changes sprite scale, body or head size, baseline, or planted-body position; the row visibly reverses into the wrong half of the loop; or 180 does not continue from 157.5 or 337.5 does not flow evenly into 000. Minor intermediate pupil or nose deviations are not rejection reasons. Exact cell cropping, resizing, and recentering happen deterministically after generation.

Use a flat pure magenta #FF00FF background. One complete unclipped pose per invisible slot. No whole-sprite rotation, replacement eyes, labels, guide marks, shadows, glows, scenery, detached effects, or #FF00FF colors in the pet.

## Attempt 1 rejection and mandatory repair

Attempt 1 had correct direction semantics and a stable foot baseline, but an
independent reviewer rejected it because the whole row used a smaller
head/body silhouette and a different face construction than approved row 9.
The `337.5 -> 000` loop closure produced a 1.27 sprite-area ratio and a 13.2 px
center jump after registration; the smaller `157.5 -> 180` join also popped.

Regenerate the entire row from scratch. Treat the attached completed row 9 as
the exact scale, head-to-body ratio, face construction, open-smile treatment,
line weight, and asymmetric hair-clip reference:

- make 180 visually the same-size next frame after row 9's 157.5;
- make 337.5 visually the same-size previous frame before row 9's 000;
- preserve both approved hair-clip groups, the viewer-right pouch, open smile,
  cyan-eye construction, bow proportions, and planted baseline in all frames;
- do not solve the mismatch by merely enlarging a finished smaller strip;
  redraw one coherent eight-pose family at row 9's native construction.

Keep the successful attempt-1 clockwise semantics and separated layout, but
reject the generation yourself if either boundary changes sprite scale,
expression family, hair-clip visibility, or head/body proportions.
